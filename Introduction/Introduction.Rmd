# Introduction

## Worldwide Problem

Chronic noncommunicable diseases (CNCDs) are the leading cause of death in the world and affect people of all demogprahic characteristics (ex., age, gender, income, etc). By 2020 was etimated that 157 million people will have one ore more choronic disease worldwide [@anderson2010chronic]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that NDCs were responsible for 38 million (68\%) of the world’s 56 million deaths in 2012. More than 40\% of them (16 million) were premature deaths under age 70 years [@world2014draft]. Based on the WHO Noncommunicalble Diseases Country Profile of 2014 of the thirty-eight million people who die each year from NCDs, those are mainly from cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes making them the four main noncommunicable diseases worldwide [@ncdWorldProf2014]. Over 14 million deaths from NCDs occur between the ages of 30 and 70, of which 85% are in developing countries. Based on the United States of America (US) National Health Interview Survey was estimated that approximately half (117 million) or 1 in 4 of US adults have at least one of the 10 chronic conditions examined in his study [@ward2014peer]. NCDs not only impose a threat to premature deaths but it also affect people’s physical and mental health, their social life, and employment status in many different ways [@anderson2010chronic].

But how we define a CNCDs? Generally are those diseases characterized by an uncertain etiology, multiple risk factors, a long lantency period, a prolonged course of illness, noncontagious origin, functional impairment or disability and incurability. [@remington2010chronic]  Various factors could be lead to the increase of NCDs. First, advances in medical science and technology are being used to treat acute illness and maintain a level of health and functionality that results in increased numbers of people surviving with chronic conditions. Second, there are other technologies that are more successfull to make better diagnosing and sometime at early stages. Third, the increasing prevalence of chronic conditions is the aging of society where at older ages increase the probability of having one or more. [@anderson2010chronic].

Chronic diseases have important shared features that aid plan and implement public health strategies such as prevention or epidemiological surveillance activites. Those features are [@world2005steps]:

- the epidemics take decades to become fully established 
- they have their origin at young ages;
- they require a long term systematic approach to treatment;
- given their long duration, there are multiple opportunities for prevention;
- health services must integrate the response to these diseases with the response to infectious diseases.


## Chronic Condition Definitions

This section define the CNCDs that will presented in this report.

- **Asthma:** A common inflammatory disease of the lungs characterized by episodic airway obstruction caused by extensive narrowing of the bronchi and bronchioles. The narrowing is caused by spasm of smooth muscle, edema of the mucosa, and the presence of mucus in the airway resulting from an immunologic reaction that can be induced by allergies, irritants, infection, stress, and other factors in a genetically predisposed individual. Common symptoms of asthma include wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath.

- **Cardiovascular disease (CVD)** refers to a group of diseases involving the heart, blood vessels, or the sequelae of poor blood supply due to a diseased vascular supply. Among the most important are atherosclerosis, rheumatic heart disease, and vascular inflammation. Cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of health problems and death in developed countries [@Dictionary.com2015Britanica]. The CVD that are presented in this report are:

    - **Heart Attack:** Necrosis of a region of the heart muscle caused by an interruption in the supply of blood to the heart, usually as a result of occlusion of a coronary artery resulting from coronary artery disease. Symptoms typically include sudden, crushing chest pain, nausea, and sweating. Characteristic changes in the electrocardiogram are used to diagnose heart attacks. Also called myocardial infarction.  
  
    - **Angina:** A severe constricting pain, especially angina pectoris. 
  
    - **Stroke:** A sudden loss of brain function caused by a blockage or rupture of a blood vessel of the brain, resulting in necrosis of brain tissue (called a cerebral infarct) and characterized by loss of muscular control, weakening or loss of sensation or consciousness, dizziness, slurred speech, or other symptoms that vary with the extent and severity of brain damage. Also called cerebrovascular accident. 

- **Diabetes:** Any of several metabolic disorders marked by excessive discharge of urine and persistent thirst, especially one of the two types of diabetes mellitus.

- **Diabetes Mellitus:** A severe, chronic form of diabetes caused by insufficient production of insulin and resulting in abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The disease typically appears in childhood or adolescence and is characterized by increased sugar levels in the blood and urine, excessive thirst, frequent urination, acidosis, and wasting. Also called insulin-dependent diabetes, type I diabetes.  A mild form of diabetes that typically appears first in adulthood and is exacerbated by obesity and an inactive lifestyle. This disease often has no symptoms, is usually diagnosed by tests that indicate glucose intolerance, and is treated with changes in diet and an exercise regimen. Also called adult-onset diabetes, late-onset diabetes, non-insulin-dependent diabetes, type II diabetes.

The diseases definitions were obtained from The American Heritage® Science Dictionary via the Dictionary.com website [@Dictionary.com2015]

## Risk Factors

Based on the dictionary of epidemiology, "A risk factor is an aspect of personal behavior or lifestyle, an environmental exposure, or an inborn or inherited characteristic that, on the basis of scientific evidence, is known to be associates with meaningful health-related conditions(s). A risk factor can be modified by intervention thereby reducing the probability of occurrence of a disease" [@porta2014dictionary]. In more direct explanation A 'risk factor' refers to any attribute, characteristic or exposure of an individual which increases the likelihood of developing a chronic noncommunicable disease [world2005steps].

 Interestingly, four behavioral risk factors are associated with those diseases; tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, poor diet, and lack of physical activity [@hunter2013noncommunicable]. Those mentioned factors are risk factors themselfe for biological risk factors determinats of chronic diseases: overweight and obesity, raise blood preassure, raise blood glucose and abnormal blood lipids [world2005steps]. It has evidenced that reduction of those risk factors and access to treatments contribute to decline mortality and morbidity associated to the NCDs [@ford2011proportion; @sytkowski1990changes], look for more references suporting this statement...  Obesity, a precursor to almost any chronic disease, acount for one third of the adult pouplation in the US and among those between 2-19 years of age 1 in 5 are obese (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/factsheets/factsheet_obesity.htm) . 
 
## Economic Impact

CNCDs affect economies, health systems, and households and individuals through a range of drivers such as reduced labor productivity, higher medical treatment costs, and lost savings [@nikolic2011chronic]. In the next 10 years, China, India and the United Kingdom are projected to lose $558 billion, $237 billion and $33 billion, respectively, in national income as a result of heart disease, stroke and diabetes, partly as a result of reduced economic productivity [@daar2007grand]. @anderson2010chronic stated that United States spent 85 percent of the health care dollar on people with chronic conditions.  Overseen the importance of planning toward reducing the risk of chronic diseases could cause an estimated production loss, among 23 low and midel income countries between 2006 and 2015, of US$84 billion due to heart disease, stroke, and diabetes alone [@abegunde2007burden]. The economic degradation occurs because an increase population with chronic diseases lead to reduce productivity and competitiveness; fiscal pressures; health outcomes; and poverty, inequity and opportunity loss [@nikolic2011chronic].

Although the economic impact of CNCDs are staggering the focus has been on treatment rather than prevention whereas the latest is where Countries can get the best results to improve quality of life and reduce the economic impact [@jamison2006disease].   Evidence highlights how millions of deaths can be averted and economic losses reduced by billions of dollars if added focus is put on prevention [@bloom2012global]. @abegunde2007burden state that an additional 2% yearly reduction in chronic disease death rates over the next 10 years would avert 24 million deaths in his 23 selected countries, and would save an estimated $8 billion, which is almost 10% of the projected loss in national income over the next 10 years.

## The Role of Epidemiological Surveillance

@alwan2010monitoring

An epidemiological surveillance system is a systematic and continuous collection, analysis and interpretation of data, closely integrated with the timely and cohoerent disseminatin of the results and assessmetn to those who have the right to know so that action can be taken. [@porta2014dictionary].

Strengthen, as appropriate, country-level surveillance and monitoring systems, including surveys that are integrated in to existing national health information systems and include monitoring exposure to risk factors, outcomes, social and economic determinants of health, and health system responses, recognizing that such systems are critical in appropriately addressing non-communicable diseases [@assembly2011political]. A key component of any national strategy to address this challenge is to quantify and monitor non-communicable diseases and their determinants through sustainable surveillance schemes that are integrated into the national information system [@alwan2010monitoring].

Following the Political Declaration on Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs) adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2011, WHO developed a global monitoring framework to enable global tracking of progress in preventing and controlling major noncommunicable diseases - cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic lung diseases and diabetes - and their key risk factors.

All countries can benefit from the comprehensive response to attaining the voluntary global targets presented in the WHO report.
\begin{itemize}
\item Global target 1: A 25\% relative reduction in overall mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases 

\item Global target 2: At least 10\% relative reduction in the harmful use of alcohol as appropriate, within the national context

\item Global target 3: A 10\% relative reduction in the prevalence of insufficient physical activity 

\item Global target 4: A 30\% relative reduction in the mean population intake of salt /sodium

\item Global target 5: A 30\% relative reduction in prevalence of current tobacco use in persons aged 15+ years 

\item Global target 6: A 25\% relative reduction in the prevalence of raised blood pressure, or contain the prevalence of raised blood pressure, according to national circumstances 

\item Global target 7: Halt the rise in diabetes and obesity 

\item Global target 8: At least 50\% of eligible people receive drug therapy and counselling (including glycaemic control) to prevent heart attacks and strokes.

\item Global target 9: An 80\% availability of the affordable basic technologies and essential medicines, including generics, required to treat major noncommunicable diseases in both public and private facilities 
\end{itemize}

The objectives of surveillance of chronic disease risk factors and selected
chronic diseases are therefore to:

- collect consistent data across and within countries;
- develop standardized tools to enable comparisons over time and across
countries/sites;
- prevent chronic disease epidemics before they occur;
- help health services plan and determine public health priorities;
- predict future caseloads of chronic diseases;
- monitor and evaluate population-wide interventions.

## The Objective of this Report/Work


To this extend the WHO

The increase in the absolute numbers of deaths is primarily due to the increase in the size and age of the world population [@murray2013disability].
