\subsubsection{Interpretation}

An estimate of 226,897 (8.08\%) adult in Puerto Rico had coronary heart disease (CHD) as of the period of 2013. When evaluating CHD prevalence by age group we observed a curvilinear increase in the CHD prevalence from the younger ages to the older ones.  When comparing the 18-24 age groups with the other age groups the difference in prevalence turn significant when compare with the 35-44, 45-54, and 65+ groups. As well, when calculating the adjusted odd ratio the increase trend in CHD prevalence through an increase in age was sustained.
Although females had higher prevalence and a 24\% higher risk than males the difference was not meaningfully nor statistical significant.

 Regarding educational level, the Some High School group had a marginal significant difference in prevalence (12.9\%) and risk (Adj. OR = .27) when compared with the other education group. We perceived this difference as meaningful for various reasons: first, the other three groups has similar prevalence and risks; second, we attribute the non-significance of the test to the statistical property of having a five fold stratification.  This lead to a reduction the power of the test; third, has been documented that low education level is determinant of low income and higher possibilities of having a chronic diseases.  Increasing the sample size via aggregating years could aid in increase the reliability of the information.
 
On marital status, Widowed participant had higher prevalence of CHD (14.7\%), finding that could be confounded by age as was shown that and increase in age lead to a direct increase in the risk of CHD.  After the adjustment the odd ratio did not showed statistical differences in the possibility of higher prevalence and marital status. Observing employment status outcomes those who are students or employed had the lowest prevalence and risk. On the contrary those Unable to Work had a remarkable higher prevalence and risk of CHD.  The difference in the unable to work group compare with the employed was statistically significant after adjustment for possible confounder variables.

Moving to the health related quality of life measures, the possibility of reporting coronary heart disease prevalence in adults that perceived their health as fair or poor was 1.41 times higher than those who considered their health as good, very good or excellent. The adults who said that they felt physically bad for 14 days or more for the last 30 days had 1.10 times higher possibility of reporting coronary heart disease prevalence than those less than 13 days. In the same manner, adults who felt mentally distressed for 14 days or more in a month had 1.27 times higher possibility of reporting coronary heart disease prevalence than those less than 13 days feeling mentally distressed. From 1.6 million adults who were unable to carry on with their normal activities more than 14 days in a month, 18.8 (14.6-22.9) percent reported coronary heart disease prevalence. Nevertheless, the adjusted estimated risk (Adj. OR) was lower than those who report less than 13 days of activity limitation.  The aforementioned Health Related Quality of Life group comparisons were not statistically significant.  In addition we did not perceived that the strength of the relation ship was meaningful.
