 \section{Remarks}

An estimate of 289,917 
(10.29\%) adult in Puerto Rico had current asthma prevalence as of the period of 2013.
When evaluating by the socio-demographic variables, no specific group has been disproportionately affected with asthma in age groups, educational level or marital status. With regards to gender the asthma was 2.22 times higher in women. Although not statistically significant those in the household income range of 35k-50k and those in the range of more than 50k annually, had \ensuremath{-1} and 0 respectively less possibility of current asthma prevalence that those  in group of those who receive less than 15k annually.

Moving to the health related quality of life measures, the possibility of reporting current asthma prevalence in adults that perceived their health as fair or poor was 3.15 times higher than those who considered their health as good, very good or excellent. The adults who said that they felt physically bad for 14 days or more for the last 30 days had 2.46 times higher possibility of reporting current asthma prevalence than those less than 13 days. In the same manner, adults who felt mentally distressed for 14 days or more in a month had 1.43 times higher possibility of reporting current asthma prevalence than those less than 13 days feeling mentally distressed. From 1.6 million adults who were unable to carry on with their normal activities more than 14 days in a month, 17.1 (14.5-19.7) percent reported current asthma prevalence. 

People who exercise, or are exposed to physical activities reported 0 \% higher risk of asthma than those who don't.  Regarding body mass index (BMI), those obese and overweight had \ensuremath{-2}\% and 1\% respectively more possibility of current asthma prevalence than those neither obese nor overweight. The estimation of the current asthma prevalence on smokers was 10.2 (9.16-11.2) percent.  Adults with diabetes were 0\5 less likely to have current asthma prevalence than their counterpart.

Progress has been made in understanding the burden of asthma in Puerto Rico. Advancements in the diagnose and treatment of the condition have had considerably improved in the last 20 years, but it is still an uncontrolled condition. The disclosed information is part of the effort of the Puerto Rico asthma Project to provide an update of the state of asthma in our country. The report presents information that can aid in the development of public policy, guide changes in the health care system, monitor population asthma control, enhance educational materials, and guide all efforts to target factors of disparities as a way of reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with asthma in Puerto Rico.

\section{Summary tables}
In this section we provide a set of summary tables of asthma among adults Puerto Rico for the years 2013. The tables aggregate all the analysis conducted in this report for an easy to print and carry document for reference, or to be used as an annex for the preparation of other documents such as an application for funds.
